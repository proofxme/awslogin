# AWS Profile Authentication Configuration

## Profile: aaico

This profile is configured for MFA-based authentication with role assumption. The setup uses a long-term profile (aaico-long-term) as the source for authentication.

### Configuration Details

- Main Profile: aaico
  - Uses role assumption with MFA
  - Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::529088279271:role/DevOpsRole
  - Region: eu-central-1
  - MFA Device: arn:aws:iam::529088279271:mfa/jorge.metalab
  - Source Profile: aaico-long-term

- Source Profile: aaico-long-term
  - Contains long-term credentials
  - Region: eu-central-1
  - MFA Device: arn:aws:iam::529088279271:mfa/jorge.metalab

### Usage

1. To authenticate:
   ```
   awslogin aaico
   ```
   This will:
   - Use your long-term credentials from aaico-long-term
   - Prompt for your MFA token
   - Assume the DevOpsRole
   - Set up temporary session credentials

2. To verify authentication:
   ```
   aws sts get-caller-identity --profile aaico
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If authentication fails:
1. Ensure your MFA token is correct
2. Verify your long-term credentials in aaico-long-term profile
3. Check that your user has permission to assume the DevOpsRole
4. Ensure the session hasn't expired (current setup uses 8-hour sessions)

### Security Notes

- Never commit AWS credentials to version control
- Always use MFA for enhanced security
- Temporary credentials are automatically managed by awslogin
